<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0"><span class="drop">N</span>O doubt you have heard how the grasshoppers&#8217; feasts</div>
<div class="indent0">&ldquo;Excited the spleen of the birds and the beasts;&rdquo;</div>
<div>How the peacock and turkey &ldquo;flew into a passion,&rdquo;</div>
<div>On finding that insects &ldquo;pretended to fashion.&rdquo;</div>
<div>Now, I often have thought it exceedingly hard,</div>
<div>That nought should be said of the beasts by the bard;</div>
<div>Who, by some strange neglect, has omitted to state</div>
<div>That the quadrupeds gave a magnificent fête;</div>
<div>So, out of sheer justice I take up my pen,</div>
<div>To tell you the how, and the where, and the when.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">The place which they chose was a wild chestnut ground,</div>
<div>(And many such spots in the new world are found,)</div>
<div><a name="png.006" id="png.006"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">6</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Where the evergreen oak and the cucumber trees</div>
<div>Rear aloft their tall branches, and wave in the breeze;</div>
<div>Where the hickory, cypress, and cabbage-tree grow,</div>
<div>And shade the sweet flowers that blossom below;</div>
<div>And the creepers and vines form a beautiful sight,</div>
<div>As they climb the tall shaft, and hang down from a height;</div>
<div>Or they mix with the long pendant moss which is found</div>
<div>Growing high on the branches, yet touching the ground:</div>
<div>From amidst the dark foliage the mocking-birds sing,</div>
<div>Or mimic the hum of the honey-bees&#8217; wing,</div>
<div>As they whirl round a flower enjoying the feast,</div>
<div>So unsparingly spread for bird, insect, or beast.</div>
<div>From afar the bald eagle is seen in the sky,</div>
<div>Now darting below, and now soaring on high;</div>
<div>Now he takes from the fish-hawk his newly caught prey,</div>
<div>And with speed to the forest he bears it away;</div>
<div>Whilst the wood is alive with a feathery throng,</div>
<div>Who from morning till night fill the air with their song.</div>
<div>On one side is the lake where the wild cattle drink,</div>
<div>And trample the rice which grows wild on its brink;</div>
<div>The freshness untouch&#8217;d of earth&#8217;s beauties declare,</div>
<div>Neither pride, pomp, nor envy, have ever been there;</div>
<div><a name="png.007" id="png.007"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">7</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Here Nature resides&mdash;nothing human is seen;</div>
<div>Foot of man hath not pass&#8217;d o&#8217;er that prairie I ween,</div>
<div>Unless some few wandering Indians have pass&#8217;d&mdash;</div>
<div>Of their sorrowing tribe perhaps nearly the last.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">I should fail to describe in a picturesque manner</div>
<div>The splendid repose of that grassy Savanna;</div>
<div class="triple">Tall shadows swept out from the forest of pine,<span
 class="ns">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
<div class="triple">The site was a fair one, the weather so fine,<span
 class="ns">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span
 class="bigmo">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<big>}</big></span></div>
<div class="triple">That even a quadruped thought it divine.<span
 class="ns">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">To this wild grassy spot, on the long look&#8217;d for day,</div>
<div>Merry parties of beasts made the best of their way;</div>
<div>There were bears, long and short-legg&#8217;d, black, brown, grey, and white,</div>
<div>From different parts, to enjoy the fine sight.</div>
<div>The polar bear came in a sledge, and she said</div>
<div>That the journey had caused a sharp pain in her head:</div>
<div>For, although well protected from snout to her tail,</div>
<div>She thought she had got a slight &ldquo;coup-de-soleil;&rdquo;</div>
<div>So she hastily called for a gallon of ice,</div>
<div>Which a monkey in waiting served up in a trice.</div>
<div><a name="png.008" id="png.008"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">8</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Then the jaguar, the couguar, and fierce Ocelot,</div>
<div>And Sir Hans Armadillo, who came at full trot,</div>
<div>Brother Jonathan Beaver, escaped from the trappers,</div>
<div>Sloth, Tortoise, and Dormouse, notorious nappers.</div>
<div>That beau, the musk-Ox, with his long scented hair,</div>
<div>And John Bull just arrived on his travels, were there;</div>
<div>Messrs. Martin, Hare, Squirrel, the Ermine, and Stoat,</div>
<div>And the rock-mountain sheep, with his cousin, the goat;</div>
<div>Then the sociable marmot, and tiny shrew mouse,</div>
<div>The raccoon and agouti from hollow-tree house.</div>
<div>Chinchilla the soft, musk and Canada rats,</div>
<div>Hounds, mastiffs, wolves, foxes, and wild tiger cats;</div>
<div>Jerboa just roused from his long winter nap,</div>
<div>Opossum, with four little babes in her lap.</div>
<div>The morse, seal, and otter&mdash;amphibious group!</div>
<div>And of bisons (the humpbacked) there came a whole troop.</div>
<div>It seems that the elk out of pride staid away,</div>
<div>Having just shed his horns, which he does about May.</div>
<div>The fallow and red-deer were gone to a lick,</div>
<div>With a numerous party, who thought themselves sick;</div>
<div>But the antelope, stag, and the Wapiti deer,</div>
<div>Notwithstanding the age of the latter, were there.</div>
<div><a name="png.009" id="png.009"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">9</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The Esquimaux dogs, red, white, brindled, and black,</div>
<div>Who, for fear of the wolves, had arrived in a pack,</div>
<div>Were not heard to speak in the course of the day,</div>
<div>And were thought by the rest &ldquo;to have nothing to say.&rdquo;</div>
<div>But if they were silent, &#8217;twas clear they could growl,</div>
<div>And on meeting the wolf, gave a wild dismal howl;</div>
<div>For although &#8217;twas supposed they were slightly connected,</div>
<div>In quarrels and fights they&#8217;d been often detected;</div>
<div>Though &#8217;tis true, all dislikes for this day were forbidden,</div>
<div>Yet mutual antipathies could not be hidden.</div>
<div>Noble horses of Spanish extraction there came,</div>
<div>The chief of whose party was terribly lame;</div>
<div>For it seems that in one of his frolicsome scampers,</div>
<div>Beneath a hot sun in the wide spreading Pampas,</div>
<div>By the rich purple fruit of the Cactus allured,</div>
<div>And feeling a thirst that could not be endured,</div>
<div>He approach&#8217;d it to eat, but his nose was not proof</div>
<div>Against the sharp thorns, so he struck with his hoof,</div>
<div>When they pierced his bare foot, and so now he limp&#8217;d in</div>
<div>With his fetlock bound up in a garter-snake&#8217;s skin:</div>
<div>The vampire-bat, surgeon, now offered to bleed it,</div>
<div>In case as he thought his poor patient would need it;</div>
<div><a name="png.010" id="png.010"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">10</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>And added, at least it could do him no harm</div>
<div>To try his specific, the juice of the palm.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">From the South came the puma, American lion,</div>
<div>Of the old house of Leo degenerate scion.</div>
<div>The tapir, and also that excellent diver,</div>
<div>Alligator, or Cayman, from Amazon river;</div>
<div>And with him the Llama, whose sad trick of spitting</div>
<div>Was thought by the company very unfitting.</div>
<div>But, to shorten my tale, all the New World were there,</div>
<div>From the tiny shrew mouse to the fierce grisly bear;</div>
<div>Though it seems that the peccary was not invited,</div>
<div>For he as a nuisance had just been indicted.</div>
<div>From the Old World, the lion and tiger with glee</div>
<div>Would have join&#8217;d them, but dreaded the journey by sea.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Beneath some fine trees, on the beautiful green,</div>
<div>A knot of philosophers was to be seen</div>
<div>Looking gravely about, and conversing together;</div>
<div>Some on learning and science, and some on the weather.</div>
<div>Dr. Mole on geology talk&#8217;d in high strain,</div>
<div>And declared his researches had not been in vain,</div>
<div><a name="png.011" id="png.011"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">11</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>And that many geologists would have been glad</div>
<div>To have found opportunities such as he had;</div>
<div>For whilst searching for food in his underground travel,</div>
<div>Midst fossils, roots, shells, hid in chalk, sand, or gravel,</div>
<div>He the monstrous remains of great mammoths had seen,</div>
<div>Who no longer existed, but who once had been;</div>
<div>&ldquo;The theories about them are various,&rdquo; said he,</div>
<div>&ldquo;As to how they came there, and what they may be;</div>
<div>But not one of these I incline to receive,</div>
<div>For that they were elephants, who can believe?</div>
<div>There was one Mr. Cuvier, who talk&#8217;d of the sloth,</div>
<div>But to listen to nonsense like this I am loth;</div>
<div>From the strength of their limbs, and the make of their paws,</div>
<div>From the shape of their bodies, and length of their claws,</div>
<div>I am firmly convinced they&#8217;re related to me,</div>
<div>And to this all philosophers ought to agree;</div>
<div>For how could such creatures have got into holes,</div>
<div>Unless, (&#8217;tis my theory,) they had been moles?&rdquo;</div>
<div>He ceased, then just turn&#8217;d his diminutive eyes,</div>
<div>First round to the company, then to the skies,</div>
<div>And receiving applause from all who sate round,</div>
<div>He threw up his hill, and escaped underground.</div>
<div><a name="png.012" id="png.012"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">12</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Signor Greyhound, a foreigner, talk&#8217;d of the swamps,</div>
<div>Of the ague and fever, both caused by the damps;</div>
<div>Then quickly proceeded the climate to quiz,</div>
<div>And exclaim&#8217;d, &ldquo;In Italia we&#8217;ve nothing of this!&rdquo;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Mr. Hog said that he had sent over his daughter</div>
<div>To England, to have all the sciences taught her;</div>
<div>And learned she was, all the world must allow,</div>
<div>For the Savants pronounced her a wonderful sow.</div>
<div>She was heard to grunt forth an unwilling apology,</div>
<div>For daring to boast of her skill in Nosology,</div>
<div>And presuming to hint what a dab she&#8217;d been found,</div>
<div>At <em>extracting the root</em>, whether <em>square root</em>, or round.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Some beavers complain&#8217;d of that biped call&#8217;d man,</div>
<div>Who does to their race all the harm that he can,</div>
<div>Some of whom, not long since, came to kidnap and pillage</div>
<div>The whole of their neighbouring water-bound village,</div>
<div>And they guess&#8217;d the snake-Indians caught many a score,</div>
<div>To stew down the tails for their great Sagamore.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">The hedgehog, who always lies snug in his nest,</div>
<div>Till his fourfooted neighbours betake them to rest,</div>
<div><a name="png.013" id="png.013"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">13</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Now changed his old custom for once in a way,</div>
<div>Unroll&#8217;d his warm nose, and came forth in the day.</div>
<div>He sought for the cow, and implored the good dame</div>
<div>Would find out some means to restore his fair fame,</div>
<div>For there still was prevailing a cruel belief</div>
<div>That oft in the night he came forth as a thief;</div>
<div>So he lived in continual danger and strife,</div>
<div>Though he never had tasted her milk in his life.</div>
<div>On the faith of a hedgehog he dared to affirm,</div>
<div>That he seldom found courage to injure a worm.</div>
<div>Mrs. Cow was astonish&#8217;d; she never had heard</div>
<div>A report more untrue, a belief so absurd.</div>
<div>She urged that his mouth was too little by half</div>
<div>To steal the sweet milk that she meant for Miss Calf;</div>
<div>And concluded by saying, &ldquo;&#8217;Tis surely enough</div>
<div>To mention (excuse me) your coat is so rough,</div>
<div>If even supposing that you should not fear me,</div>
<div>I never could suffer your skin to come near me.&rdquo;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">An old porcupine, too, just begg&#8217;d leave to observe,</div>
<div>That reports had been spread which he did not deserve;</div>
<div><a name="png.014" id="png.014"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">14</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>To say he was &ldquo;fretful,&rdquo; was using him ill,</div>
<div>He would prove the reverse to his very last quill;</div>
<div>Though he now bristled up at the simple idea,</div>
<div>This was often, with him, but a symptom of fear.</div>
<div>As he spoke, a poor toad, who had sate quite aloof</div>
<div>In a hovel of earth, with a stone for a roof,</div>
<div>Now slowly, on tiptoe, crept out of his hole,</div>
<div>And into the midst of the company stole;</div>
<div>The quadrupeds gazed as the reptile drew nigh,</div>
<div>Half afraid of his looks, though they could not tell why.</div>
<div>Mouse&#8217;s hair stood on end, and, still stranger to say,</div>
<div>Miss Chameleon <em>changed colour</em>, and fainted away.</div>
<div>Poor bufo confess&#8217;d, as he sate in the dark,</div>
<div>He had listen&#8217;d to porcupine&#8217;s brilliant remark,</div>
<div>And had thought it was due to himself and posterity,</div>
<div>T&#8217; expose a new case of the poets&#8217; temerity.</div>
<div>The poets, who kindly, but falsely, had said,</div>
<div>That he carried a beautiful gem in his head;</div>
<div>A jewel he thought would be quite out of place,</div>
<div>With his rustic brown coat, and his sallow green face,</div>
<div>And he knew not how people could think it was true,</div>
<div>Unless they had seen him when spangled with dew.</div>
<div><a name="png.015" id="png.015"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

 /></span>His Surinam friend could they possibly mean,</div>
<div>Who carried her little ones set in her skin.</div>
<div>Those alone were the jewels his friend ever wore,</div>
<div>Like Cornelia&#8217;s, the good Roman matron of yore.</div>
<div>Having stated the case with regard to attire,</div>
<div>He said, with some warmth, that he did not spit fire:</div>
<div>And he ask&#8217;d why the wise ones omitted to hint</div>
<div>Where he carried his tinder, his steel, and his flint:</div>
<div>That his time was more usefully spent, he might say,</div>
<div>In chasing the vagrants and spectres away.</div>
<div>Every member of reptile society knew</div>
<div>That of insects and grubs he destroy&#8217;d not a few:</div>
<div>His wife had just miss&#8217;d a huge pioneer spider,</div>
<div>Who fled to his home, and then rudely defied her,</div>
<div>And e&#8217;en bang&#8217;d his door in her face to deride her.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div><ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:

<div>But that now this once pleasant and rural retreat,</div>
<div>By his tenant, the owl, was no longer kept neat;</div>
<div>That the little round chamber, and long slanting hall,</div>
<div>For the want of attention, were likely to fall;</div>
<div>Such a mess and confusion he could but deplore,</div>
<div>And he thought, at the least, she might plaster the floor,</div>

<div>The poor owl, who spoke well in the prairie-dog tongue,</div>

<div>I awoke very early to come to this feast,</div>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
